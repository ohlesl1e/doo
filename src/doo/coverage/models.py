"""Coverage result models (ADR-0034 — per-query typed models over a base).

The coverage analyzer is a *pull / ephemeral* shared library (ADR-0034): every
query function returns typed Pydantic results, and both the `doo coverage` CLI
and the slice-3 planner consume the same models. There is deliberately no
generic `CoverageGap` envelope — the four slice-2 queries return structurally
different shapes (C1 yields Endpoints, C2/C2b carry per-principal evidence
tuples, C3 yields pivots), so a shared envelope would be lossy.

`CoverageResult` is the small shared base every per-query model extends:
`engagement_id`, the `query_id` discriminator, and the `generated_at` stamp of
the query run (event time of the *analysis*, not of the underlying facts). Each
row also carries the **effective (decayed) confidence** computed at query time
per ADR-0005 — confidence is never re-written in storage, only decayed by
consumers on read.

Pydantic v2, strict-ish (`extra="forbid"`) so a stray field is a loud error and
the `--json` form round-trips exactly.
